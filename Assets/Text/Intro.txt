Hello, welcome to your situation.
You are in trouble with the law.
Stealing assets, characters, anything copyright, you took it.
And corporations and companies like Dis***, Nin***do, Mar***...
They're all trying to suck every last cent from you.
Now don't worry, because there are three lawyers that are willing to help.
All top-class lawyers, each with the power to help you win your case.
The problem is, they're all kidnapped. It's your job to save them.
Now that door in this room is a portal to hell, where Se** hid one of the lawyers.
If you succeed, I'll open the portal to the next spot, until you get all three lawyers.
Beware, I haven't helped anyone in 50 years, so these portals... might be malfunctioning.
Worry not, they all still work.
Just press the "E" key to open it.
Don't ask why it's "E", and don't complain "Ugh, why not the 'Enter' key or the mouse click."
It's "E", and I'm not changing it.
Also, if that mouse cursor is annoying, just press escape twice.
Anyways... good luck.
