Hey, thanks for coming for me.
Welcome to the lazylands, where the creator was too lazy to make a place that looks decent.
Right now, Holk is angry, and he just noticed you talking to me.
I don't know how, but he's basically Superman right now.
Over far away is a giant chill pill. Throw it at him.
You only get one shot.
Use the "E" key to pick it up, just like opening the doors.
After that, the LMB to throw it.
He should calm down after and the door can open.
Eg*rap*** would be so angry at this game for explaining controls like this.
