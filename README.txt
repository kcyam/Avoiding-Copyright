Game: Avoiding Copyright

	Short description:Avoid the copyrighted characters and save yourself through different




Long Description:

History and thought process:
	In this game, the objective is to find five lawyers while dodging well-known franchises' intellectual property including mascots, catchphrases, items, and more. It started in class while we were learning about UI. Professor Josh Durica was explaining how to make a bar for adjusting and he used Mario and Luigi. I thought to myself "ooh, I'm reporting them to Nintendo", and then my idea clicked in my head. It's basically a Slenderman ripoff (or any runaway from danger game) but I wanted to add more than just "run away from monster". I want to add things like puzzles, both visually and audibly, and defending your ground. (Wait, that sounds like a good way to get a lawyer. Show your position and how determined you are to stand your ground for a bit.) It's midterms week for me. Two midterms and the reading quiz for this class. 

Ideas:
The five lawyers are actual real lawyers with groundbreaking resumes related to franchising.
Checkpoints after getting each lawyer. 
Audio clues (e.g. hearing a Disney song means that a mascot character is near)

Well, I pushed this until the end because this was the most stressful, busiest two weeks of this year so far. I didn't get to implement things the way I wanted, so I rushed and cut corners, which is why it's so bad. I shrunk the lawyer count to three and yeah, it's not as good as I wanted it to be.
